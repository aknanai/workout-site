What you eat is just as important as how you train. Understanding basic nutrition principles will help you maximize your workout results and feel your best.

## Understanding Macronutrients

Your body needs three main macronutrients:

### Protein
- **What it does**: Builds and repairs muscle tissue
- **How much**: 0.7-1g per pound of body weight for active individuals
- **Best sources**: Chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes, tofu

### Carbohydrates
- **What they do**: Provide energy for workouts
- **How much**: 40-60% of daily calories for active people
- **Best sources**: Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, oats, sweet potatoes

### Fats
- **What they do**: Support hormone production and nutrient absorption
- **How much**: 20-35% of daily calories
- **Best sources**: Avocados, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish

## Pre-Workout Nutrition

Eating before a workout ensures you have energy to perform. Try these guidelines:

**2-3 hours before**: A balanced meal with carbs, protein, and fat
- Example: Grilled chicken with rice and vegetables

**30-60 minutes before**: A light snack focusing on carbs
- Example: Banana or toast with honey

## Post-Workout Nutrition

After exercise, your body needs nutrients to recover. Within 30-60 minutes:

- **Protein**: 20-40g to support muscle repair
- **Carbs**: To replenish energy stores

**Great post-workout options:**
- Protein shake with banana
- Greek yogurt with berries
- Chicken breast with sweet potato

## Hydration Tips

Water is essential for performance and recovery:

- Drink at least 8 glasses (64 oz) daily
- Add 16-24 oz for every hour of exercise
- Monitor urine color - pale yellow indicates good hydration

## Sample Day of Eating

Here's what a balanced day might look like for an active person:

**Breakfast**: Oatmeal with berries, nuts, and protein powder

**Mid-morning snack**: Apple with almond butter

**Lunch**: Grilled salmon with quinoa and roasted vegetables

**Pre-workout**: Banana and a handful of almonds

**Post-workout**: Protein shake with banana

**Dinner**: Lean beef stir-fry with brown rice and mixed vegetables

## Common Nutrition Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

1. **Skipping meals**: Leads to overeating later
2. **Not eating enough protein**: Hinders muscle growth
3. **Eliminating entire food groups**: Usually unsustainable
4. **Relying on supplements**: Whole foods should come first

## Final Tips

- Meal prep to stay consistent
- Read nutrition labels
- Don't obsess over perfection
- Make sustainable changes you can maintain long-term
